# Setup instructions

_This project has been set up using [Terminal Tools for SilverStripe](https://github.com/titledk/ttools-silverstripe)._

Follow the instructions below to get up and running with development (or readying your server for deployment):

1. Clone this repo locally
2. Set up an `_ss_environment.php` file in your root (you can copy it from `devfiles`) and edit the database settings
3. Update your submodules: `git submodule update --init`
4. Run `composer install` from within `public` (if you don't have composer installed, follow [these instructions](http://doc.silverstripe.org/en/getting_started/composer#installing-composer))
5. Point a web root to `public`, and enter it

You should be good to go!
